Exploration driven development is a different paradigm to most software engineering exercises. `sciflow` mixes the strengths of the notebook environment: flexibility, access to data and constant feedback with the strengths of production-like workflows: resilience and dedicated compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "* Separate the aspects of your research that need to be validated in a production environment from your exploration journey.\n",
    "* Know that your notebooks are of high quality, consistent style and that they are always in good working order.\n",
    "* Automatically convert your exploratory workflows to highly visible, managed workflows.\n",
    "* Explore faster: execute your current notebook-based workflow while writing it; accelerating the pace at which you can explore your problem space.\n",
    "* Track experiments simply with almost no modification to your existing workflow.\n",

    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "A popular approach to productionising research code in notebooks is to lift the workflow from notebooks to a python modules via a manual rewrite process. Sometimes one person will have the skills and ability to perform this task but mostly it will be a collaborative effort to understand and rewrite the code for more robust production ready purpose. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a team you can get to be good at this process but there is always a lag between the exploration being performed now and the ability to test that out in live environments. If the person writing the experimental approach was able, without switching hats to \"development mode\" to see their exploration validated safely by production users then this should be transformative for the impact of Data Science in your organisation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The discipline of Software Development offers many approaches to ensuring code is of high quality with consistent style and testable assertions on known data. Data Science and Machine Learning introduce new Software Development challenges that are not as well explored by the community. In Data Science behaviour is a more fundamental unit for testing than logic for instance so tests on real user data will show your model works as expected syntethic data is unlikely to achieve the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern notebook environment have a common advantage in practice over many local development environments and that is that Data Scientists can write code against real data with all the quirks and anomolaies and underlying behaviour that they are actually trying to develop a solution against. We start by assuming only that there are high levels of uncertainty and that the code needs not only to work but to be well conditioned to real operating environment. "
